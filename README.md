# LocalEstate

Made a fullt responsive Local Estate Website Using HTML CSS & JavaScript.
I've developed a fully responsive Local Estate Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website's primary goal is to help people find houses and allow others to rent out their properties without the involvement of any agents. 

# Technologies Used
The technologies employed include HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I utilized Swiper.js for seamless image-swiping functionalities.
